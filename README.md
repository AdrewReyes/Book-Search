# MERN Book Search Engine

## Description

This is a full-stack MERN application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API, save their favorite books, and manage their saved books. The app uses a React front end, a Node.js/Express.js server, MongoDB with Mongoose, and Apollo Server for a GraphQL API. Authentication is handled with JWT, and users can sign up, log in, and save/remove books from their personal collection.

## Features

- Search for books using the Google Books API
- View book details: title, author(s), description, image, and link to Google Books
- User authentication with JWT (sign up, log in, log out)
- Save books to your account
- View and remove saved books
- Responsive and modern UI with React and React-Bootstrap
- GraphQL API with Apollo Server and Apollo Client
- Deployed on Render with MongoDB Atlas
